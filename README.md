# Continual Learning in Reinforcement Learning

## Project Objectives

The main objective of this project is to investigate the concept of **continual learning** within the field of **reinforcement learning (RL)** applied to board games, specifically to the game *Squadro* and its variants. The key objectives include:

- **Develop** a functional version of the board game *Squadro* that serves as an experimental platform.
- **Apply** continual learning techniques to enable the agent to learn continuously over multiple games, without forgetting previously acquired knowledge.
- **Evaluate** how the use of continual learning improves the agent's ability to adapt to variations of the game, such as rule changes or board size adjustments.
- **Conduct experiments** to measure the agent's performance and the computational complexity of the system under different continual learning conditions.
- **Explore** how continual learning can optimize game strategies, allowing the agent to improve over time without requiring complete retraining.
